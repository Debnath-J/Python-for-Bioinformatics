# Python-for-Bioinformatics
Contains code made on python 3.x for solving different problems of bioinformatics 
(e.g., getting basic properties of DNA, RNA or protein sequences, finding ORF as well as getting amino acid sequence from a reading frame) 
without implementation of Biopython.

Basic DNA information.py - for finding general information from DNA seq.

ORF finder.py - for finding all possibl orf from six readin frames of DNA

DNA to Protein.py - for finding all the ORFs as well as their translated amino acid seq.
